- 👋 Hi, I’m @brounhownd
- 👀 I’m interested in learning coding basics and exploring ways to use code to solve larger problems in my workflow and to process, visualize, and share data.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript, HTML, and CSS on FreeCodeCamp.org
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on sharing ideas and thoughts on learning to code as a hobby and personal growth path.  I'm also interested in plugging into open-source projects at whatever level I can.
- 📫 How to reach me: email is bggaston@gmail.com and my twitter is @brounhownd
